Takeaways from our catch up:
1. We all went to school in NY area!!! (I mean! what are the chances!)
2. Moving forward with idea #1 Reddit posts from WallStreetBets sentiment correlation with stock price for selected stocks (list of stocks TBD) because we could not figure our how to aggregate the data for #2 idea - Meat-to-mood correlation
3. Next step is for Ksenia & Mike to share 1st draft for Project proposal before the end of next week (Feb 19). Ksenia will check with TA that our idea meets the reqs for data/calculation/visualization
Deadlines: Feb 19 Form team - DONE (i will double check that we dont need to do anything else aside of filling out excel); Mar 12 (~ 4 weeks)- Project proposal, ppt slides and video - Ksenia & Mike are responsible for the proposal. Ryan - do you want to do ppt and video recording? We can decide who presents if there are volunteers. I would also say we should have data pulled and cleaned by that time - but this is dependant on having clear reqs from the Proposal
We did a high-level division of roles & responsibilities and this is what I thought it looks like:
1. Ksenia - PM
2. Ksenia & Mike - research, writing. Data/modeling in python if needed
2. Steve, Chao - data/modeling, front end/visualization
3. Ryan - ppt, data/modeling
