PAKQB3,"2021-03-16, 18:45:52",m6p4rq,1,"I joined Reddit 44 days ago because I read an article about what happened with GME in January.  I wanted to learn more.  I read and read and read.  Admittedly I didnâ€™t always understand everything I read so I Googled, YouTubed, and read more.  

On March 3rd I bought 54 shares of GME for $125/share.  By the time I was done with a shower, the stock was down $7.  I panicked and sold.  I literally owned the stock for less than 1 hour.  Yeah, I know.  Toilet paper hands!

Then I read and read and read some more.  I started watching Bloomberg, CNBC, fox business, etc.  and I kept reading.

Three things convinced me.

1.  Massive amounts of DD by extraordinarily talented smart Apes

2.  The community effect - no ONE is as smart as EVERYONE.  The idea that 1,000s or 10,000s or 100,000s or even 1,000,000s could be drastically wrong doesnâ€™t make sense when coupled with awesome DD

3.  The Media.  If you are a Karen or Ken who believes media outlets are a place to get truth, this isnâ€™t for you.  The Media is owned and orchestrated by money and only money.  Nothing else.  And the Media has consistently misreported and outright lied about what has happened and what is happening with GME, this Reddit community, HFs and our Govâ€™t.  Combine this with 1 and 2 and the truth was clear to me

I believe this is 2008 again.  Lots of people know.  No one wants the truth to come out as it will crush HFs, some investment banks and brokerages.  The cascade could/will impact the markets in total and it will require govâ€™t intervention.  But...(a) THIS IS THE WAY the system can be fixed in some important ways that have been screwing everyone except mega-rich (e.g., naked shorts, ability to short even with SSR in place, manipulation with high frequency trading, etc) and (B) THIS IS THE WAY a lot of brave little guys get to table turn and make a buck!

TLDR:  I bought 76 shares on 3/6 for $140.  Iâ€™ve been adding since.  Today I have 220 shares averaging $219.  I have multiple limit buy orders to buy dips.  I will NEVER sell until we are $2M+.  

Point of the story:  if you are a newcomer, and you decide to jump in based on your own DD and certainly not because of anything I am sharing as I pick my butt and sniff my fingers while eating crayons, buy and HOLD.  It wonâ€™t be easy with the wild swings.  Check in with the Ape community for morale support.  This is a great pride of apes that have shown each other tremendous support!

MilaRoc,"2021-03-16, 15:55:57",m6ls2r,1,"Alternative trading mechanisms, ATs, are algorithm trading bots used by institutions (broker-clearing firms, other trading venues, etc.) to process large orders and their clients at a lower risk. These transactions are made by HTFs (high-frequency trading) which process large numbers of trades in a manner of milliseconds. 

The reason they were designed is avoid market volatility which large transactions can induce if they are placed all in once. ATs bots, called traderbots, distribute the shares in dark pools, in a way they don't get seen, with the purpose of limiting disruptions on price prematurely revealing positioning by large investors and institutional clients.  

At first, ATs and its regulations were designed to trade shares done in â€block transactionsâ€ around 10k to 500k in size, with a lower price fees than the average market pays for the transactions. That is fundamentally why they exist, that is regulated and there is nothing illegal about it. The problem is when institutions use these ATs for manipulating the market. Namely in the attached article as â€toxicâ€ market participant (behavior by market makers). In a data research attached in the paper it was discovered that instead of â€œblock transactionsâ€ the number of shares regularly exchanged are done by an average of 181 shares per transaction.

There is not transparecence in the way how markets institution and affiliates uses ATs, if they don't get caught it is discretionary to the them to check the wrong deed.

Here is Barclayâ€™s disclamer piece from their analysis about misuse of dark pools, which they were fined and apologized for:

â€œThe analysis also determined that the trading venues to which Barclays routed unfilled orders (after first having routed them to its own dark pool) tended to be venues hosted by high-speed trading firms, â€œ[n]one of which,â€ recalled one Director, â€œhad a reputation for being favorable to clients from an execution perspective.â€ Those venues included Knight Capital, Getco, and Citadel.

These clients, sited above, is anyone who uses brokerages firms, meaning anyone who trades independent of a HF (YOU) or not in the market.

[Extract]

-How these companies uses this leverage and create a toxic market participant behavior: 

a) to front-runs transactions, 

b)  to avoid regulation, 

c)  to sell securities short without borrowing (referred to as naked short sales by the SEC), 

d) constantly enters orders it intends to cancel for the purpose of spoofing the market, 

e) layers trades on top of each other not intending to execute them, but as a means to control the marketplace pricing (price suppression),

f) to virtually provide services on demand for its clients regardless of whether they are operating legally or not, what Shitatel provides for HF like Melvin Capital.

Does that sounds familiar??? 

A lot of institutions uses ATs in smaller fractions of millisecond speed-when you see your level ll and â€times and salesâ€ charts running a race so fast that you can't track the numbers; that is what we are talking about. Or large body candles out of context with the overall price action; that as well. There are many ways how institutions can use this algos to manipulate the market and when they don't have the shares, they borrow from someone else. Then is when number of shares don't make any sense.

The author of the paper went a step forward saying that â€ATSs and dark pools are in essence, a private market.â€

The idea is that this forms of trading by High frequency traders such as Traderbot using dark pools, when misused, harm price discovery altering the fundamental functioning of the capital markets. 

How is this becomes illegal? 

â€If dark pool operators route client trades to a cooperating third party and then become the other side to those trades, then dark pools would be acting for their benefit as opposed to protecting their institutional client and providing a fair and efficient market. Moreover, this hypothetical scenario would constitute illegal pre-arranged trading in violation of a number of securities laws. This would clearly be against the public interest, the protection of investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and is contrary to the spirit of Regulation ATS and the anti-fraud provisions of federal law.â€

When a share is sold by a market maker to an institution, then to the investor by the same Traderbot that operates from the clearhouses to it's affiliates is where transparency lacks and itâ€™s intent can becoming malicious practices. Where they can be short sales not backed by borrowed assets, a.k.a. â€naked shortingâ€ sold for full price and incooporated to the ATs operatorâ€™s books (not sent to NSCC/DTCC for clearance and settlement). Which results in undisclosured securities positions and numbers exceeding the amount of shares a security has on their total float. Such as we see in GME, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks. Itâ€™s one of the techniques that shitty HF hedge themselves in the market.

My first DD on WSB! And yes of course I'll add the obligatory ""this is not investment advice but rather my own opinion based on publicly available information. Carefully consider your own investment objectives and risk factors before investing.""

I donâ€™t know about you folks, but I guess after a few down days and a $224/share avg I needed some reassurance that our GME will indeed take off one day. So, I dug deep into the memory banks and recalled one important supply-demand ratio from my investment finance classes, namely the Turnover Ratio (TRO). 

Do you ever notice how some stocks seem to soar suddenly, often with little or no news? While other stocks can receive ongoing great news and hardly move higher at all? Well, my smooth brained apesâ€¦as you can imagine itâ€™s all about supply and demand.  

At the end of the day what makes a stock rise in value? If you answered â€œmore buyers than sellersâ€ than you win a banana! So how do we compare one stock to another and determine how changes in demand can affect the upward (or downward movement) of the price? 

A quick definition check: 

10-D AVG VOL (10-day average volume): Reflects more current trading activity, expressed as average daily volume over the last 10 trading days 

FL (Float): Weâ€™re all well versed on this one, but just in case float is â€œthe number of shares outstanding, or all the shares there are for that company, minus what is owned by insiders and what the company is holding back (treasury stock). In a nutshell, associate the float with the supply of shares available to be traded at any given time by the public.â€ 

So with those definitions in mind, I decided to pull Yahoo Financeâ€™s Top 25 most active stocks for today, March 16th and dive right in. Most active stocks are listed in order of todayâ€™s volume. I then added additional columns for, you guessed it, 10-D AVG VOL and FL. 

This now sets us up for the simple TURNOVER RATIO (TRO) calculation, which is 10-D AVG VOL / FL. 

If the float is very large relative to the average volume (lots of shares out there to be bought and sold in relationship to the average volume) we would see a low turnover ratio and thus an onrush of buyers would not move the price much (think Ford stock) 

However, if the float is low relative to the average volume (a lot of people wanting very few available shares,) a sudden rush of buyers could move the price of a stock dramatically (think Gamestop).

So how does our precious little GME rank. Have a look and see for yourself! 

GMEâ€™s TRO is 93%. Ninety-Three Per Cent!!! 

That's 25% higher than the next highest security (SNDL), and a whopping 86% higher than the entire group average!

This essentially means 930 out of every 1,000 tradeable shares of GME have changed hands every single day over the last ten days. 

This tells us GME is a VERY volatile a stock that will trade violently given an imbalance in supply or demand either to the up or downside.  

So let me ask you this: Did you sell your stock recently? Did you? What about you? I sure as hell didnâ€™t? So how the fuck is this possible? Easy. This is exactly what all the brilliant DDâ€™s before me have already confirmed: There are synthetic GME shares out the whazooo being traded ALL DAY LONG. With short and naked-short interest estimated anywhere between 2-5x float we are about to witness a historic imbalance play out before us. 

My fellow apes and ape-ettes, we are patiently waiting for liftoff on the â€œrightâ€ side of this very equation. All we need to do is HOLD and continue to keep this Turnover Ratio in our favor. The greedy idiots that decided to double and triple down on GMEâ€™s demise WILL be held accountable someday very soon. 

And donâ€™t forget to ensure your 5-pt harnesses are buckled up tight. When this thing takes off weâ€™ll be pulling G-forces thatâ€™ll peel our eyelids back and leave a stream of diarrhea behind us.  

See you in the Oort Cloud!

 **$AMC has significant short covering! More to come!**

We see this starting as of March 10th and this drove up demand volumes on price. Remember the price only goes up if there are more buyers than sellers. By keeping an eye on short covering you can, to some extent, predict how much intrinsic buying demand there is in a stock. There are many unknowns however including how many other sellers may be taking profits, closing positions OR new buyers entering.

**$GME not THAT much short covering! A lot more potential here!**  
You can quickly compare AMC to GME and see that shorts are not covering in the same way and in the last couple days the price has actually been falling. What this tells me is other holders are simply selling, maybe people are worried, but the shorts are not driving up the price.... yet! This bodes well for HODL!

**$RKT covering only started TODAY!**

RKT has been trading sideways and consolidating. I've covered this stock in some other DD and it looks ready to go up. There are still some paper-hands that are selling but as of today we're seeing the shorts panic with the latest optimistic housing data. They realize this isn't going lower and want to get out NOW before they get crushed.... I see a BIG OPPORTUNITY....

**$BB a constant battle between the shorts shorting and covering! Looks like they are losing though!**

**$NOK absolutely no short covering or anything notable! This stock is SO BORING but I LOVE IT!**

**TLDR:**  
**$AMC: This week a lot of short covering driving price UP. More to come! Looks good.**  
**$GME: Only a little bit of covering, relatively, so there are a lot of shorts that are not covering and likely do not feel like they need to yet! HODL**  
**$RKT: Short covering started only today! Prepare for takeoff!**  
**$BB: It's a battle right now and unclear who is winning just yet!**   
**$NOK: Absolutely NOTHING happening**

I don't even know how Reddit works. I've got a friend who tells me I'm crazy for being a part of this. But I've been through a whole host of crazy market events:

* *Dotcom crash*
* *9/11 crash*
* *housing crash*
* *COVID crash*
* *and now, the Gamestop short squeeze*

Financially, I've made out well in every scenario for being a contrarian (financially disciplined and often betting on the long term upside during short term catastrophes). Here I am, again taking a positive position with contrarians. This time against the notion that Gamestop as a company is done. Against the notion that it should be shorted into oblivion by the Hedgehogs. Against the notion that ""smart money"", that those with immense financial resources, always win. Against the notion that the system is rigged against the retail investor, from the days E\*TRADE was airing ads of the retail investor throwing bricks through bulge bracket firms' windows (cannot find a link to this commercial) to the days that RobinHood made a similar marketing promise.

**What We're Up Against**

It's hard to imagine the scale of the money involved, so I'll give a hypothetical example. For a sense of scale, if I had 10 billion dollars on one side of a stock trade, and the slippery morals, I could put out $1,000,000 contracts to have FIVE THOUSAND GME apes assassinated, and still come out with $5B remaining. If you have doubt about short ladders, media manipulation, character assassination, brokerages restricting trades, or LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE being possible, I hope my example illustrates what else is possible with that much money.

**Wisdom and Typical Behavior**

Having been through all of the above, I know that people in power do EVERYTHING they can do to maintain it, legal or no, ethically shady or no. And--to their advantage generally--the mob is like a flock of birds, each following the tail feathers of the one in front of it. Sometimes people in power harness this truth about groups of people, sometimes they attack it. We've seen a little of both in this situation. But what's unique here is that there are many birds in this flock that fly North in the springtime because they have a strong Reason to.

**Fundamentals of the Company vs Fundamentals of the Market**

I may not understand the intricacies of the market, I may not know all the factors that tie a share of a company to the fundamentals of the company. For the most part, I agree with Mark Cuban that they are these days much divorced.

But...I do know how supply and demand works: people who buy GME and hold own the supply, people who shorted the stock are saddled with their chosen demand. That's a fundamental of the market that was exposed by this movement, and its effect is undeniable.

**The Trade**

When I read about WSB buying GME and others because the meme was funny, the nostalgia was real, and the short squeeze was possible, it appealed to me. I took a 5% percentage of my portfolio and moved it into GME, AMC, and BB (in that order in percentage, and I've consolidated those positions into GME fully since in order to focus). I categorized the trade mentally as a ""do or die"", that is it either moons or flatlines (binary trade). Thus, at the onset my goal was set.

**This is the Way**

I had a gut check when GME went over $400, because like many others, it was a huge return. I also had one when the price sunk to $40. But I didn't sell out, because that wasn't my reason for the trade in the first place. In fact, I'm pretty proud to say that I bought on the trip down, increasing the amount of shares bought all the way down to low 50s. My position relative to my portfolio TRIPLED from 5% to 15%. As a do or die trade, I will hold it long after the memes stop coming, the nostalgia wanes, and hopes of a short squeeze fade...or until my patience allows me to watch it moon.

Why can I hold rather than ""cut my losses""? Because it was a binary trade from the get go. There was no loss limit. I'm financially disciplined and that's the decision I made at the onset when I chose to do it the diamond hands way, the autist with retard strength way.

**My Reason**

And while it's funny AF to be a part of this history (I bought shirts for my fiancee and her boyfriend, and I contributed to the commercial GoFundMe, and now I've even dusted off my Reddit account to get enough Karma to attempt a post on WSB), there's a deep source of my retard strength: Reason. No, not reason as in it is reasonable. Quite the opposite. I'm stubbornly unreasonable.

My Reason is that I bought in because I've also seen a lot of vampirism of the ultra wealthy on those who get by. I witness the parasites of Wallstreet hoover trillions during the aforementioned market events while the rest of us paid for it. I've seen student debt requirements and interest rates rise drastically all the while. I've seen the media bought and paid for and weaponized against us a hundred times over. I've seen money change hands for a pandemic relief that didn't relieve those truly in need of it. I've seen countless efforts by regular people to take away the controlling levers the ultra powerful use to prey on them squashed. Over and over and over again. I've said, ""It's not right, but it's the way of the world"" and, ""If you cannot beat them, join them"" tens of times if not hundreds. Be the world as it may, when something isn't right, you call it out for what it is. And sometimes, when you can, you devote a bit of your own small share of power to it. That's my Reason.

**I Hold.**

Don't waste your ""concern for me"", don't try to tell me about the ""next Reddit trade"", don't try to tell me that I should ""wait on a whale"" (news flash: this whole thing is happening because...Retail. Is. The. Whale.), or try to tell me about any of the other misinformation campaigns out there. Ultimately since the strength of the GME short squeeze relies on people holding, efforts by bots or shills--it makes no difference--to get those holding to sell are in essence advocating for the other side of the trade. Moon or die, I won't be on that side of this trade.

**""I HOLD."" -- me, every damn day since this started.**

In fact, I bought more yesterday during the dip.

***TL;DR: I went into the trade with eyes wide open as a high risk, high reward trade. I usually don't take on these ""bets"", but this one resonated with me because of the vast amount of class injustice I've witnessed in my life. Doesn't sit right with me to either sit on the opposite side of this trade or on the sidelines. So I hold moon or die. Naysayers can GTFO of here.***

Again, this is stretch fucking crazy BUT with the way the FED is printing money and playing with the bond yields throughout this extremely volatile stonk trading while also basically neglecting its implications makes me think that it is exactly what they want to happen (hopefully). IMHO the world is fucked in so many ways rn and our most effective tool to fix the problems we face is based in science and innovative technologies that complement each other in an exponential fashion (AI/Machine Learning).

I truly believe that the Meme stonk revolution was orchestrated by a benevolent group of people that saw how broken our current market system is and found an opportunity to destroy it and replace it with a system more aligned with being one of those complementing innovative technologies to be used for an overall improvement of current outdated systems and the world.

WSB TLDR: ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€$IRWDðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

TLDR: Ironwood Pharmaceuticals Inc is a strong buy out candidate due to their flagship drug Linzess and its current partnerships, a otherwise very limited pipeline, recent unexpected CEO exit, and (most importantly) large insider share purchase from activist investor Alex Denner of Sarissa Capital whose focus is on increasing shareholder value usually through forced acquisition


**The Thesis**


**Product**

Ironwood Pharmaceuticals ($IRWD) is a biotech company that focuses on gastrointestinal drugs. They currently have one major drug, Linzess (linactolide), which is a novel action drug used to treat IBS which was approved in 2012. Since that time, it has been an excellent drug and has steadily been making consistent revenue for Ironwood (~$400M revenue in 2020, $106M GAAP income). They are partnered with AbbVie for US brand and commercialization collaboration, this is key as they could be a potential suitor. In Japan they are partnered with Astellas, and in China with AstraZeneca.  Ironwood's other pipeline products have either been unsuccessful over the past 5 years or are pre-clinical (ie so early they don't yet provide much value and in fact cost a lot of money in valuation). This has been destroying shareholder value as all the money made by Linzess is not being reflected in the share price and the company is not doing well on developing another blockbuster drug.

**Sarissa Capital and Alex Denner**

In case you aren't involved much in biotech, Alex Denner is the big swinging dick no board member wants in their company. Mainly because his MO is to infiltrate your board, buy up a bunch of the company, and then leverage it to increase shareholder value (his own mostly, but also he says yours). Usually this means sale of the company. He started out under Carl Icahn at Icahn Partners but then spun off and started his own company Sarissa Capital. Here are the last three company's he has been involved with: Ariad (Takeda purchased for $5.2 billion), Bioverativ (Sanofi purchased for $11.6 billion), and The Medicines Company (Novartis acquiring for $9.7 billion). All of these were at premiums around 50-75% of current traded share price. 

**Alex Denner and Ironwood history**

Sarissa approached Ironwood in 2018 about Denner joining their board. From a news article at the time, ""But after three meetings with Denner to better understand his intentions for the company, Ironwoodâ€™s executives decided they werenâ€™t thrilled with the prospect of him on their board. In a statement, the company said Sarissa hadnâ€™t made a strong enough case to appoint Denner, considering the boards existing diversity."" Here was Denner's response after the share price jumped 10+% at news of his interest: â€œTo the extent that they state in their press release that theyâ€™re concerned with what investors want, Iâ€™ve been told that more value has been created for Ironwood shareholders today than in any single day in their history.â€ Fucking legend. [Full press release here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sarissa-capital-issues-statement-on-ironwood-pharmaceuticals-300657237.html) centered on how Ironwood should be improving shareholder value. 

While Ironwood initially rebuffed him joining their board in 2018, they did implement many of his recommendations from the press release above. Namely, separating their R&amp;D division into its own separate company instead of funneling all of the great revenue their flagship and established drug was producing into failing pipeline drugs. 

Then in late 2019, they all the sudden let him join the board. His comment at the time, â€œI look forward to working with my fellow board members to create value at Ironwood.â€ 4 month later in 2/2021, the CEO of only 2 years steps down rather unexpectedly and an interim CEO is implemented. 1 month later, Denner starts buying up shares. 

**Insider buying**

So I noticed that Denner bought about $13M in shares on 3/02 which was shortly after the announcement of the CEO leaving, this brought up his ownership to over the SEC rule of 5% meaning he now needed to file a Form 4 every time he made another purchase. This seemed pretty fucking suspicious timing wise with the CEO leaving so I've spent the last few days looking into Denner's history and prior involvements with other biotech companies, particularly those that were bought out. While I was doing this, the motherfucker bought $10M more shares in large batch orders (one on 3/05 and 3/10). I strongly suspect he has actually bought much more than this because there have been several large block purchases over the past few days as well. But the forms for &gt;20% influencing owners SEC reporting are different than if you are say a ~10% passive owner and I suspect these take longer to come through (10 day allowance per the SEC). So I will be on the lookout for if a Schedule 13-D from Denner comes through the SEC. I am not the most knowledgable about the SEC form requirements so I could be off base here. [Here is an article about this difference in SEC filing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule13g.asp#:~:text=3%EF%BB%BF-,Schedule%2013G%20is%20a%20shorter%20version%20of%20Schedule%2013D%20with,meets%20one%20of%20several%20exemptions.)

With the recent purchases, IRWD has become Sarissa Capitals largest portion of their portfolio (total value around $1 billion) at 16.32%, [see here](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/sarissa-capital-management-lp)

**How I am playing this**

The timeline is difficult to assess on this. At earliest, the purchase would not likely be for 6 months given SEC rules on insider buying. Thats even if he plans to create a buyout at all. I belive given Denner's history, the lack of pipeline, the pre-existing commercial partnerships, and need for more global footprint of this drug the best option is to sell to AbbVie or some other large partner. I do not see Denner attempting to buy all of these shares just to install a more shareholder friendly CEO.

Given that the timeline is variable and possibly mid to long term. I bought shares and calls in August and leaps for Jan 2021 at $15 and $20 strike. I think a bear case buyout would be $15 and best case would be $25 but I expect somewhere around $20 given his previous history. The leaps were just added today so the premiums are inflated but I will be looking to buy more of these over the next few weeks to months. The August calls were cheap as dirt. I will be following the options prices closely and adding a bunch more as the buying power of options is much higher than straight shares and I have strong conviction this sale will happen in 2021.

Intro

* My fellow apes, did you miss your ticket to the moon/ still holding your ticket to mars with GME? Well here is a brand new prospective outlook that I have put some thought into. This aint no ticket to mars thou, RIOT is a possible fucking ticket to Uranus (the furtherst we could possibly go).
* Over the past few weeks I have been critically reflecting and decided to pen down my thoughts on a prospective for a long term stock outlook for RIOT. And as the underlying asset value drops temporarily I see this as a great dip buy potential with major upside prospects.

Current Economic Climate

* With Biden signing the 1.9 Trillion USD Covid relief into law, an estimated 17 million people will receive $1400 USD as their discretionary income. With the meme-fication of the stock market, investment has gained traction among the younger generations of millennials and gen z. Reports predict that most of COVID relief checks will contribute to rent and essentials, but a growing proportion of the population will use this â€˜free discretionary incomeâ€™ to put into the stock market.
* Linking this to Riot, Raconteur research infographic has demonstrated that it is the newer generations that are most interested and most likely to get into alternative decentralized sources of asset diversification investments. With Riotâ€™s earnings report releasing on March 31st that works in conjunction with all these events, the potential for a spike and parabolic move could be significant.
* In terms of a longer outlook on the asset that RIOT procures and sell, the influx of big institutional buyers and interests (MicroStrategy, Tesla, Galaxy Digital Holdings, Ruffer Investment company, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan) has solidified alternative assets as a â€˜holdable-assetâ€™ and a far better hedge for inflation relative to gold. Either for long-term capital growth, or an inflationary hedging asset (with a faster than expected rebound of the global economy, interest rate and inflationary increase is a major concern for institutional players).
* In particular, JPMorgan has recently issued a prospectus investment debt instrument that introduces proxy stocks to this aforementioned trend, where riot will constitute 15% of the portfolio and will continue to introduce more institution money into the picture, amplifying the returns of RIOT over the coming years.

RIOT an â€œunprofessionalâ€ Technical Analysis

* So we know based on a statistical analysis over the past 2 years that RIOT has over a 90% correlation to the underlying asset it procures and sells. However RIOT has 3X relative volatility to its underlying asset it procures and sells. - To simply put - say RIOTâ€™s underlying assets increase by 5% in its market value, RIOT which procures and sells this asset increases is expected to increase by 15% - which is 3 times relative more to its underlying asset. Why is this the case? Simply put RIOT has a much smaller mkt cap compared to its underlying asset driver therefore it takes less cash inflow to increase the share price and cause possible parabolic upside swings.
* With this in mind, I will now focus on a more technical side, examining RIOTâ€™s price action behavior.
* Elliott Wave Analysis - â€œThe Elliott Wave Principle posits that collective investor psychology, or crowd psychology, moves between optimism and pessimism in natural sequences. These mood swings create patterns evidenced in the price movements of markets at every degree of trend or time scale.â€ - Straight from Wikipedia
* Typically there are 5 Elliot waves before a slight correction. As illustrated in the diagram we have just entered wave 5! This means we can expect a bullish momentum in the market up to the possible price target of 230.48 which historically is the key -2.0 fib extension level. But hey if you get them diamonds hands the sky's the limit and the upside potential is as high as ur diamonds hands can hold.
* Fibonacci Retracement - The Fib levels are key areas of support and resistance. The start of the 5th Elliot wave was propagated by a retracement of the 0.618 Key Fibonacci resistance level in confluence with large institutions ( i.e Tesla - Elon Musk) buying the main underlying asset that RIOT procures and sells. Papa Elon bless thy gains.
* The recent onboarding on large institutions including banks such as JP Morgan offering debt instruments which constitute 15% RIOT stock diversification for this new trend further allows boomers to diversify into such stocks, creating a long term demand and driving up prices of RIOT in a possible parabolic manner over the upcoming year.

RIOT, shit is getting serious, the setup

* It can't be stressed enough, but just think of this RIOT play on a macro physiological level. We have the largest of the largest companies and institutions buying into a limited supply of the asset RIOT procures and sells. We have boomers slowing turning over and buying into RIOT through Big Banks such as JP Morgan's novel debt instruments. We have retail investors - the diamond hands GME bag holders with a Hella of a strong APE mentality. And RIOT the fucking company which mines and sells this underlying asset at the forefront of all this potential upside gains. RIOT has nothing to lose from this trend, only positive prospects.
* Think about this fucking insane unprecedented surge in the demand of RIOTS underlying asset which is limited in supply. Guess what happens next where this massive influx of demand meets this limited supply for an asset? A fucking possible insane parabolic move upwards. And RIOT the most prominent company for this trend has insane relative stock volatility. RIOT is possibly going to the moon guys are you hopping on that ride? LMK if my analysis is trash but I firmly believe we are standing at the crossroads of history which side are you taking?

Competitors and why RIOT is remains king

* So now you are asking yourself is RIOT the better stock correlation play to this underlying asset? Personally based on my due diligence I lean towards RIOT for the following reasons. The other main competitor has seen to have high compensation packages, 2 share dilutions in a span of several months - while they have the largest expansions their ongoing costs are astronomical, their increase in cost % was larger than their increase in rev%.
* The other main competitor while having the potential to have the largest operation in my opinion is just too risky (this is in my uneducated financial opinion).
* RIOT on the other hand, has stronger fundamentals with strong leadership, the number of share dilutions is only one at a much smaller mkt cap indicating that they clearly value shareholder wealth perseverance more than the other main competitor, as they do not relays heavily on equity financing at the expense of shareholders as much as the other main competitor does.
* RIOT looks like the more sturdy Rocketship that would get you from earth to the moon and then fucking mars possibly. A year from now when we possibly see RIOT worth over $1000 per share then we can look back and remember our fallen GME, AMC, NOK and BB brothers and tell them hey we fucking made it.

Conclusion, RIOT to the moon?

* Stay strong fellow apes and always remember â€œwe can remain retarded longer than shorts (trend naysayers) can remain solventâ€. We like the stock plain and simple, RIOT to the fucking moon?
* Just a reminder, this is purely for entertainment purposes, this is very much so an unprofessional financial perspective and outlook on RIOT, do your own due diligence, never invest more money than you are willing/ able to lose for anything you see on this subreddit. Good luck guys.","{'neg': 0.149, 'neu': 0.705, 'pos': 0.146, 'compound': -0.9924}",-0.9924,neg,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE

Max326,"2021-03-17, 09:10:30",m73w2c,3,"Hello there, fellow apes.

I'm here to ask a question that has been with me for quite a long time. The deeper we are with buying and HODLing $GME, the less I'm seeing reasonable bearish posts or comments about that stock (to be exact, I'm seeing none). I'm really trying my best to find any negative analysis on our fucking moon-rocket on WSB and other $GME-related subreddits and I'm not really finding shit. 

I've been reading many DDs, Technical Analyses, Discussions, you name it.

For example, this seems solid and explains much about short selling and why they shorted Geee Emm Eeeee in the first place:

[https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/GMEv10.pdf](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/GMEv10.pdf)

What bothers me is this: Is this possible by mods deleting all the bearish stuff about $GME, or is it really that good? I mean ALL (99%) of bearish stuff can be found on CNBC, Jim Cramer's babbling and others, but here? NONE of that gets any recognition. All I saw here on WSB, was a post saying that we should keep putting pressure on them by buying options with a strike price closer to the current price, and just putting all we can afford in shares.

Is it really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and not pouring our whole savings in it is plain stupid? I'm a college freshman and I poured everything I can in it (that I can afford to lose), but is it worth just fucking pouring in EVERYTHING? If there's no bad outcome, except a fucking miraculous save by the government, or some DFV's evil clone appearing on the other side out of thin air, why is it not on the moon yet? Is it that people don't understand the stuff going on with GameStonk and that's the reason behind not going in? I'm seriously running out of ideas what could go wrong with that. 

As far as I understand, the HFs are just kicking the can down the road in hopes for the company falling. They just keep shorting the company, bleeding money on paying premiums to their brokerages. Correct me if I'm wrong, but to me, that's like postponing the inevitable death! They're making it a fucking nightmare for who'll have to cover the shorts for them when they inevitably run out of money and the squeeze finally hits.

I mean, what the fuck? It's that I'm not understanding something, or they are more retarded than the whole WallStreetBets community combined.

And no, I'm not complaining about being a millionaire if it hits 100k, I'm here with my 6 shares and holding. (where I live a US dollar is 3.87 in our currency rn)

TL;DR why can't I find any bearish posts on GME ANYWHERE besides the news? And we know that news are connected directly to HFs, so that's just bullshit and won't make any sense. I wanted to get some reasonable thesis about $GME not mooning, but no success.","{'neg': 0.113, 'neu': 0.812, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': -0.9783}",-0.9783,neg,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

Top of the morning to you fine people! Been looking around for a free service to track the options interest but only found paid ones. So I wrote one and I'm handing it over free-of-charge!

Word of advice, I recommend using google chrome; got some weird caching happening in Firefox. If you keep getting cached versions of the scatter plot, use incognito, that 100% refreshes it.

[https://optionsentiment.live/](https://optionsentiment.live/)

Added the meme stocks to the first page as links for easy navigating, but you can search for any ticker by using the search bar.

Some explanation of what's there;

For example, let's take: [https://optionsentiment.live/option?symbol=gme](https://optionsentiment.live/option?symbol=gme)

For every ticker, you get a Scatter Plot and a Sankey; Puts are red, calls are green.

Since this is using yahoo finance to get all its numbers from, I had to think of a way to not make a call every time someone wants to look at these. The solution I came up with was to cache each image for 5 mins.

So if the last snapshot was taken less than 5 minutes ago, you get the cached image. If not, you get a brand-spanking new one and it will replace any existing cached images.

I'm not a web developer by trade, so the site itself is pretty basic. But I can improve it if I can get it to a) pay for its own hosting and b) earn some income on the side to merit working on it.

\--------

First off, hello and kudos for doing what you do. I'm observing Reddit, specifically WSB, for quite some time now. Followed the $GME saga with big interest, and vouching for you since end of February when I caught the actual story behind it. It's absolutely refreshing, and I hope the movie will catch it all.

I did invest a big load into $GME, but got ass-kicked with the recent free fall and lost my earnings from a whole month. Not something to worry about, because I never invest more than I can afford to lose. Still annoying to lose money, especially to hedgies and other people who play unfair.

I'd really like to throw another, actually much bigger load on $GME. Not essentially to make quick gains (for sure this is a factor), but I'm intending to keep at least half of the shares, because I like gaming.

However, I never do the same mistake in life twice. So, before I do it - which I really, REALLY would like to do - I need to understand options, how they work, weather and how they impact price and volume.

I've read a bunch of articles about it, and while Investopedia is a great source and generally provides the best informations, I'm still unable to catch the whole thing. There's always a lot of Jibbering, FOMO and FUD in it. I get that options are complicated and risky, and even professionals have their issues understanding them.

I'm not interested in things like risk factors and ""tips for my well-being"". I'm ONLY interested in the rules, the rest is upon me. I like numbers and facts, and I like when they're covered by good sources.

Please, my little ape friends, give me a good reason to be stupid again on $GME. Please, just provide me the rules, and just the rules.

Word of advice, I recommend using google chrome; got some weird caching happening in Firefox. If you keep getting cached versions of the scatter plot, use incognito, that 100% refreshes it. 

[https://optionsentiment.live/](https://optionsentiment.live/)

Added the meme stocks to the first page as links for easy navigating, but you can search for any ticker by using the search bar. 

Some explanation of what's there; 

For example, let's take: [https://optionsentiment.live/option?symbol=gme](https://optionsentiment.live/option?symbol=gme)

For every ticker, you get a Scatter Plot and a Sankey; Puts are red, calls are green.   


[Easier to see the broad picture in the scatter plot](https://preview.redd.it/p6nkiyi7xkn61.png?width=757&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9112ae3f7002ed42f93f4e795790573df9d50d01)

[you can hover on the Sankey to get exact number of contracts while also seeing the broad picture](https://preview.redd.it/iiecsdodxkn61.png?width=908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc0246d9d42724b5959ee29193b3357fa930b52c)

Since this is using yahoo finance to get all its numbers from, I had to think of a way to not make a call every time someone wants to look at these. The solution I came up with was to cache each image for 5 mins. 

So if the last snapshot was taken less than 5 minutes ago, you get the cached image. If not, you get a brand-spanking new one and it will replace any existing cached images.

I'm not a web developer by trade, so the site itself is pretty basic. But I can improve it if I can get it to a) pay for its own hosting and b) earn some income on the side to merit working on it.

$VIAC is up:

143% over the past 3 months  
39% over the past 1 months  
and down 9% on the week....

For reference, $GME has a short interest of around \~20%. Viacom is at 17% right now, but it was higher in the past few weeks. $VIAC hit a high of $101 but there was virtually no coverage of this stock being shorted, $GME dominates everything, despite $GME dropping from 150% short to 20%, I think the only thing I ever saw on VIAC short interest was over a month ago on CNBC.

Of course GME is one of the biggest or most noticeable ones but look at others - the dip is the same. Was there some news or was it a big, massive, ""UGE"" sell off by a single entity? Or.... my conspiracy theory brain is firing away but my logical self has to think this is normal and there is an explination.

Something happened at 12:17 and lasted until 12:40. You can see it in a lot of stocks. It's so precise. Exactly 12:17 and each bottoms the V at 12:40. Even the ones that are ""off"" are off by a like minute.

GME exactly 12:17 crash. Over at 12:40

AMC - exactly the same time

KOSS same time

My small retard brain couldn't stand the looses while holding - I took major brain dmg while watching the stonk drop like a rock (totally legit) so please excuse my crayon drawings on that.

This is what I found:

This was January 28th when this rocket was about to lift off (not red crayon circles):

[Picture from first \\""peak\\"" -\&gt; drop on 01\/28 \(THE SQUEEZE WAS NOT SQUOZEN THEN\)](https://preview.redd.it/t5bq1w8vy9m61.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f68eafd364a77125efb084625da706fe358daba1)

As you can see GME reached a price of around 419$ per share (\*rocket emoji\*)

This is a picture of todays lift off (once again - red crayon pls):

[Picture from second \\""peak\\"" -\&gt; drop today \(STILL NOT SQUOZZON\)](https://preview.redd.it/dvioxc15z9m61.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fb03f6460c9698726ea2f4aa7ada74ee112f9e3)

As you can see GME reached a price of around 340$ per share today and it was just starting the lift off.

The super smart monkeyfellas maybe already noticed (so probably nobody cause nobody is reading this anymore)

In January it took them about 80 minutes to dumb the price to 152$... (I am just rounding here cause you get the idea even without the exact numbers)

[Totally legit free market chart #1](https://preview.redd.it/v6o17ousz9m61.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4480463cc33f1bfe08ced9c3193dcb60368bc64)

This is how it looked today... It took them only 30 minutes to dumb the price back to 219$ per share (I guess it even dipped to 170$ right?). 

[Totally legit free market chart #2](https://preview.redd.it/0juhe66oz9m61.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c0c7ddcf6063521e5f3be1d5110b8e0bd7b20a9)

So that is already pretty sus ... but not yet finished - lemme get a new banana for the next part:

After this huge dip the price stabilized - on both scenarios:

On the first ""peak"" in January it looked like that:

[Moving back up - Ending at 224$ per share](https://preview.redd.it/sajvxbzb0am61.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=153fb3807bd607a22ecdb0975a44ed9766b66063)

Today it looked like that:

[Moving back up - Ending at 265$ per share](https://preview.redd.it/8vvnw77g0am61.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cb8913c3ecae3f5e65c623a98304a9ec82d4f52)

So it seems like this total madness already happened to us on January 28th. Somehow I totally deleted this painful experience from my brain - probably some retarded diamond hands copeing mechanism ... They did it once and we returned back!

Sadly this story doesn't end well as many of you apes might know - the stock kept diving into the ground. Probably there were other circumstances with Vlad scking the hedgies dcks and stuff .. but as a retarded ape who has 35 shares @ 118 

*Processing img rw9zj0uc1am61...*

I am kinda pissed. I really hope that this time the whole thing will turn around and don't get dumbed like last time. Cause if this isn't market manipulation at its best then I dont know (besides the fact that AMC, BB and KOSS had the exact same patterns).

SnooApples4563,"2021-03-10, 11:13:40",m25szi,1,"Hello WSB, this is my first official post, but I'm very proud to see how we have all HODL together really strong.

I have been in GME since 30 Oct 2019 with an additional 1670 shares on 29 May 2020 and I wish I could take a screenshot to prove my words, but my custodian account does not allow any screenshots out of ""security"" reasons. I currently hold over 6 digits of value in GME and I hope to reach my 7 digits and possibly 8. After what happened today, my 7 digits is certain, 8 digits possible. With more crayons maybe I'll reach 9.

That being said I like to share and encourage with everyone why this nosedive drop we seen today is actually the BEST affirmation we really need.

There's been wonderful DD that the Short interest are still extremely high and that the data in FINRA is entirely unreliable. Let's be honest, before what happened today, no matter how certain we are, we weren't 100% sure.

I'm an expert in Chinese history, and I'll quote Sun Tzu, the famed author recognised for writing the Art of War over 2000 years ago.

â€œIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.â€

Truth is we never really knew what the hedges were up to and this week was really fishy, with the absence of obvious short ladders and peaceful markets. Other than occasional dips everyday after reaching a peak, we couldn't tell much. Some people have speculated that maybe the hedges were buying calls in order to reduce their risks, but I think we can all agree now that there is a good possibility that the dips we've been seeing the last few days are just a test for hedges to see how much the price can be affected.

And let's be honest with ourselves, that was a coordinated attack. I have no idea how long they have planned that, but looking from what we've seen, it's definitely a lot of time. At that scale it's not possible for 1 or 2 hedge funds to pull this off by themselves. And YET!! This is where we recovered strong.

So what this means is this. The hedges are panicking. They are worried. And they have proven that the shorts *HAVE NOT BEEN COVERED*. If they have been covered to the large extent they claimed to, today's coordinated attack wouldn't have happened.

Not just did they admit with their actions that they are fearing us, they also basically highlighted to us what stocks they are all massively shorting. AMC, KOSS, NOK, BB all are in this together with us GME Army! 

You know it's like Harry Potter, where Voldemort basically handed the weapons to Harry by his own hands.

Based on Chinese History, there's this clever strategist Sun Tzu. For him before he executes any clever maneuvers for war, he will always test them first. If the hedges we are up against are the same smooth brain people like Sun Tzu, this fall is only a test. But it's costly to them and we have held strong. With the current prices, supposing they did buy some shares to cover their losses, all those buys from 180 to 250 are all gone. Now they are forced to buy shares above 260 and its only going to cost them even more. Much better for us.

Fellow apes, they are really afraid of our gamma squeeze this week and next week.

Now... We strike back, by doing NOTHING!","{'neg': 0.1, 'neu': 0.72, 'pos': 0.18, 'compound': 0.9966}",0.9966,pos,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE

This might sound stupid or crazy, because I am just a crayon eating dipshit. But here is what I think just happend. No financial advice, just a theory, bla bla bla.

**TL;DR** I think the Hedgefunds that want to fuck Shitadel &amp; Friends just caused this drop by selling a large amount of shares, in order to trigger the SSR and to load up some shares and options with a lower base price / premium.

I. In order to trigger the SSR, the price had to drop to $222.21.

ðŸ“·

I will add the official NYSE confirmation of the SSR trigger, as soon as they update the SSR list. (01:22AM TMRW)

II. The price rose steadily with more and more options becoming ITM. Before the real Gamma Squeeze starts, they want to make sure, that Shitadel &amp; Friends can't short GME tomorrow.

ðŸ“·

III. While GME dropped down to $172 (from $340, holy shit), almost all Stocks in my Portfolio went red and looked the same. I think that was someone liquidating assets, in order to load up on a lot more GME Shares and Options later today or tomorrow, so the Gamma Squeeze will be even bigger.

**Edit: (7:52PM)** Seems like a was right with this ""I think that was someone liquidating assets, in order to load up on a lot more GME Shares and Options later today or tomorrow, so the Gamma Squeeze will be even bigger.""

V. Why trigger it now and not at opening? That's just pure speculation, but maybe they wanted to see, if people hold and buy the small dips today. People did and that gave them the cofirmation, that there won't be huge sell offs when this Rocket launches. (See picture @ point II)

**My theory of what is about to happen**: As I am writing this, the price currently sits at $205. **If it starts to rise really really fast again, we might just see the start of the Gamma Squeeze.** Trading will get halted multiple times, don't be scared! If you just bought this dip: Congratulations, future millionaire!

**Will it start today? I don't think so, but it's possible!** We **could** see a rise in price today and tomorrow GME will moon, because the SSR rule\* is in place. I think we will close at about $250 - $ 280 and tomorrow we'll go to the moon before the Short Squeeze.

\*What is the SSR Rule? The short-sale rule or SSR, is also known as the alternative uptick rule or SEC rule 201. The SSR restricts short-sales on a stock that has declined in price by 10 percent or more from the previous day's close. Once triggered, the SSR remains in effect until the end of the following trading day. That means they can only short on upticks. But not on downticks. What happens when they short on upticks? Nothing. They did that the last few days, the price dropped $10 - $15 and immediatly recovered a few minutes after.
